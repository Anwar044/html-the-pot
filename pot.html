      <h2>What is marijuana?</h2>
      <p>
        Marijuana refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the
        Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica plant. The plant contains the
        mind-altering chemical THC and other similar compounds. Extracts can
        also be made from the cannabis plant

          (see "Marijuana Extracts").</a

        According to the
        <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/">
          National Survey on Drug Use and Health,</a
        >
        cannabis (marijuana) is one of the most used drugs in the United States,
        and its use is widespread among young people. In 2021, 35.4% of young
        adults aged 18 to 25 (11.8 million people) reported using marijuana in
        the past year.1 According to the
        <a href="https://monitoringthefuture.org/"
          >Monitoring the Future survey,</a
        >
        rates of past year marijuana use among middle and high school students
        have remained relatively steady since the late 1990s. In 2022, 30.7% of
        12th graders reported using marijuana in the past year and 6.3% reported
        using marijuana daily. In addition, many young people also use vaping
        devices to consume cannabis products.

      <h2>How do people use marijuana?</h2>
      <ul>
        \
        <li>People smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints)</li>
        <li>In pipes or water pipes (bongs).</li>
        <li>
          They also smoke it in blunts—emptied cigars that have been partly or
          completely refilled with marijuana.
        </li>
        <li>
          some people are using vaporizers. These devices pull the active
          ingredients (including THC) from the marijuana and collect their vapor
          in a storage unit. A person then inhales the vapor, not the smoke.
          Some vaporizers use a liquid marijuana extract.
        </li>
        <p>
          People can mix marijuana in food (edibles), such as brownies, cookies,
          or candy, or brew it as a tea. A newly popular method of use is
          smoking or eating different forms of THC-rich resins
          <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/">(see "Marijuana Extracts").</a>

      <h2>How does marijuana affect the brain?</h2>
      <p>Marijuana has both short-and long-term effects on the brain.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Short-Term">
      <h3>Short-Term Effects</h3>
      <p>
        When a person smokes marijuana, THC quickly passes from the lungs into
        the bloodstream. The blood carries the chemical to the brain and other
        organs throughout the body. The body absorbs THC more slowly when the
        person eats or drinks it. In that case, they generally feel the effects
        after 30 minutes to 1 hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marijuana over activates parts of the brain that contain the highest
        number of these receptors. This causes the "high" that people feel.
        Other effects include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>altered senses (for example, seeing brighter colors)</li>
        <li>altered sense of time</li>
        <li>changes in mood</li>
        <li>impaired body movement</li>
        <li>difficulty with thinking and problem-solving</li>
        <li>impaired memory</li>
        <li>hallucinations (when taken in high doses)</li>
        <li>delusions (when taken in high doses)</li>
        <li>
          psychosis (risk is highest with regular use of high potency marijuana)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Marijuana also affects brain development. When people begin using
        marijuana as teenagers, the drug may impair thinking, memory, and
        learning functions and affect how the brain builds connections between
        the areas necessary for these functions. Researchers are still studying
        how long marijuana's effects last and whether some changes may be
        permanent. <br />
        For example, a study from New Zealand conducted in part by researchers
        at Duke University showed that people who started smoking marijuana
        heavily in their teens and had an ongoing marijuana use disorder lost an
        average of 8 IQ points between ages 13 and 38. The lost mental abilities
        didn't fully return in those who quit marijuana as adults. Those who
        started smoking marijuana as adults didn't show notable IQ declines.5
      </p>
      <p>
        In another recent study on twins, those who used marijuana showed a
        significant decline in general knowledge and in verbal ability
        (equivalent to 4 IQ points) between the preteen years and early
        adulthood, but no predictable difference was found between twins when
        one used marijuana and the other didn't. This suggests that the IQ
        decline in marijuana users may be caused by something other than
        marijuana, such as shared familial factors (e.g., genetics, family
        environment).6 NIDA’s Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
        study, a major longitudinal study, is tracking a large sample of young
        Americans from late childhood to early adulthood to help clarify how and
        to what extent marijuana and other substances, alone and in combination,
        affect adolescent brain development. Read more about the ABCD study on
        our

      <h2>What are the other health effects of marijuana?</h2>
      <p>
        Marijuana use may have a wide range of effects, both physical and
        mental.
      </p>
      <h3>Physical Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Breathing problem.</strong> Marijuana smoke irritates the
            lungs, and people who smoke marijuana frequently can have the same
            breathing problems as those who smoke tobacco. These problems
            include daily cough and phlegm, more frequent lung illness, and a
            higher risk of lung infections. Researchers so far haven't found a
            higher risk for lung cancer in people who smoke marijuana.8
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Increased heart rate.</strong> Marijuana raises heart rate
            for up to 3 hours after smoking. This effect may increase the chance
            of heart attack. Older people and those with heart problems may be
            at higher risk.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Intense nausea and vomiting.</strong> Regular, long-term
            marijuana use can lead to some people to develop Cannabinoid
            Hyperemesis Syndrome. This causes users to experience regular cycles
            of severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, sometimes requiring
            emergency medical attention.14
          </p>

      <h2>Mental Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Long-term marijuana use has been linked to mental illness in some
        people, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>temporary hallucinations</li>
        <li>temporary paranoia</li>
        <li>
          worsening symptoms in patients with schizophrenia—a severe mental
          disorder with symptoms such as hallucinations, paranoia, and
          disorganized thinking
        </li>
        <p>
          Marijuana use has also been linked to other mental health problems,
          such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts among teens.
          However, study findings have been mixed.
